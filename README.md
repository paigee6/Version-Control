Our code takes the user's name and age, then subtracts it from the current year. It provides a range of two possible years to account for birthdays that may not have occurred yet this year. For example, at age 18, the code would state that the user was born in 2006 or 2007, to account for the range of birthdays within the year. The program outputs a personalized message with this information.
